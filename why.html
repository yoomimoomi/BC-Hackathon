    <h1>Why Duo-Do?</h1>
    <p>Duo-Do was designed with one goal in mind: to help you make a positive change in your life by pairing you with a buddy for mutual accountability and support. If you spend long hours on your computer and feel the need to strike a healthier balance, Duo-Do offers you a fresh, engaging approach to improving your well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Who is it For?</h2>
    <p>Duo-Do is ideal for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Busy Professionals:</strong> Individuals working in environments that demand prolonged screen time.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Workers:</strong> Those who often work from home and need a nudge to balance work and wellness.</li>
      <li><strong>Anyone Seeking Change:</strong> If you're looking to break free from a sedentary routine and adopt a healthier lifestyle, Duo-Do is for you.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buddy System:</strong> The app requires you to start by teaming up with a buddy, ensuring you have someone to keep you motivated.</li>
      <li><strong>Track Screentime:</strong> Submit your buddy’s and your own screen time to monitor and reduce excessive use.</li>
      <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> Choose a physical activity to help you stay active and counterbalance your sedentary work life.</li>
      <li><strong>Daily Check-In:</strong> Log your mood with a quick emoji-based check-in, tracking your emotional well-being.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Engage in guided practices like meditation, yoga, or mindfulness to reduce stress.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Our design is heavily research based and minimalistic, ensuring a clean and functional interface that serves as more than just an app—it’s a lifestyle tool. We’ve built Duo-Do to be brutally effective in achieving its goal: transforming your daily routine through accountability and self-improvement. This commitment to simplicity and function is at the heart of our approach, and that's what makes us special.</p>
    
    <p>The app operates on a monthly cycle, where you commit to these functions for one month. At the end of the month, your progress is compared against an average performance benchmark. Although you can disable up to two functions based on your needs, all four are highly recommended for a holistic experience.</p>
