#  Duo-Day! – The Accountability Buddy System  

Duo-Day! is a **minimalist lifestyle app** designed for individuals looking to make **real changes in their daily routines**. Whether you're a remote worker struggling with screen time, a busy professional in need of an activity boost, or someone looking for mental wellness support, **Duo-Day keeps you accountable – with a buddy.**  

This app isn't just about tracking habits. It’s about **committing to a change and following through – together.**  

## We believe it is essential for us to consult with professionals before we start talking about a problem and starting to resolve it. In our short 3 day production cycle. We consulted a pre-liscensed therapist and a practicing Organizational therapist.

##  Why Duo-Day?  

**Duo-Day was created to solve a common problem:** Many people want to improve their lifestyle but lack the accountability to stay consistent. Traditional habit-tracking apps rely on individual motivation, but Duo-Do flips the script by introducing a **buddy system** that keeps both users accountable.  

This app is designed with **research-backed methodologies, a brutally functional approach, and a minimalist UI** to ensure **maximum efficiency without distractions**.  

> ** It’s not just an app – it’s a system that works.**  


##  Key Features  

Duo-Day! is built around **four core functions** – you can disable up to **two**, but **all are highly recommended** for best results.  

###  **Track Screen Time**  
 Submit **your buddy’s screen time** and receive theirs. Stay accountable for cutting down excessive device usage.  

###  **Fitness Commitment**  
 Select a **daily physical activity** (running, stretching, bodyweight exercises, etc.) and check in with your buddy.  

###  **Daily Check-In (Mood Tracker)**  
 Submit an **emoji-based check-in** – sad, neutral, or happy. Reflect on your progress, mood, and mental state over time.  

###  **Mental Health & Mindfulness**  
 Engage in **guided meditation, yoga, or mindfulness practices** to stay mentally balanced.  

 **One-Month Challenges:** Duo-Day operates in **monthly cycles**. After 30 days, your results are **compared against the average performance of users**, helping you measure your growth.
